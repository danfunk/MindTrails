                <p>THANK YOU for taking the time to get this application
                    up and running! We really hope it serves your needs and
                    lets to get your study / training underway.</p>
                <p>This base site allows you get started with a fully functional
                    mobile ready website. You can customize every aspect of this system.</p>
                <p>Some things are very simple, like changing the logo, updating
                    the content of this page, which only takes adding in a few files in the
                    right places. Other changes are more complex and will require you
                    to write a little Java. But we've done our best to stream line this
                    process heavily, and are always working to make this a more
                    intutive process.</p>
                <p>To Override this page, just create a file called
                    /resources/templates/index.html and put whatever
                    content you like there.</p>
                <p>Just be sure to include a link for logging into
                    your Study... Like this one:</p>
                <a th:href="@{/login}">
                    <button>Log In</button>
                </a>
                <a th:href="@{/account/create}">
                    <button>Create Account</button>
                </a>
            </div>
